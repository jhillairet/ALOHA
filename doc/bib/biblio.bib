Particular attention is devoted to the derivation of a power transport equation in agreement with conservation of energy, and to the formulation of appropriate boundary conditions when the waves are launched by electrically short antennas. The ray equations are then applied to investigate the occurrence of radial reflections, which can affect the accessibility of the plasma core to HF heating; examples are given for waves in the Lower Hybrid and in the Ion Cyclotron frequency ranges. Finally, the use of the power transport equation for the evaluation of power deposition profiles during HF heating of Tokamak plasmas is illustrated by the example of Lower Hybrid waves launched by a phased waveguide array.},

To this end, they have simultaneously solved Maxwell equations and the ion kinetic equation, starting from the antenna and proceeding towards the centre of a plane-layered plasma. As a consequence of the development of a suprathermal tail in the ion distribution function, the efficiency of the absorption increases and the absorption region is found to shift to lower densities as the launched power increases. Absorption is always complete at the layer where the wave phase velocity equals about three times the local ion thermal velocity, usually somewhat before the linear turning point is reached.},

  Abstract                 = {A phase-controlled lower hybrid wave (LHW) multi-junction (MJ) coupler (3(rows)?4(columns)?4 (subwaveguides)) has been developed in the HT-7 tokamak. Simulations show that it is more effective for driving plasma current than an ordinary phase-controlled LHW antenna (3(rows)? 12(columns)) (traditional coupler). The plasma--wave coupling experiments show that the reflection coefficient (RC) is below 10\%, implying that the MJ grill can launch the wave into the plasma effectively. The effect of power spectrum launched by the MJ coupler on RC indicates that an optimal condition is requisite for a better coupling in the lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) experiments. Studies indicate that the drive efficiency of the MJ antenna is higher than that of the traditional one, which is mainly ascribed to the discrepancy in impurity concentration, plasma temperature, and spectrum directivity. An improved confinement with an electron internal transport barrier is obtained by LHCD. The analysis shows that the modified negative (low) magnetic shear and the change of radial electric field profile due to LHCD are possible factors responsible for the eITB formation.},

Interest in this problem arises from the possibility of operating tokamak reactors in the steady state. The low-frequency waves most suitable for this task are identified in terms of the power cost for deployment in a reactor. Means of exciting these waves and tradeoffs with design criteria are discussed. A comparison is made with the alternative attractive regime of high-frequency waves. Conclusions are based, in part, on the numerical solution of the two-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation with an added quasi-linear term due to the waves.},

Data obtained on Petula-B indicate that both the heating efficiency (4.5 eV × 10 13 cm ?3 ·kW ?1 ) and the parametric dependences of the reflection coefficient are very similar to those of a conventional grill. Therefore, such a multijunction grill may greatly simplify the construction of grills considered for use in future large-scale tokamaks.},

The plasma density and its gradient at the mouth of the grill are estimated from probe measurements made with plasma conditions similar to those of the experimental coupling data. The qualitative agreement is always very good and a quantitative agreement is obtained in a relatively high density regime.

  Abstract                 = {The Advanced LOwer Hybrid Antenna (ALOHA) code, has been developed to improve the modelling of the coupling of lower hybrid (LH) waves from the antenna to a cold inhomogeneous plasma while keeping a fast tool. In contrast to the previous code Slow Wave ANtenna (SWAN) (that only described the interaction of the slow wave between the waveguides and the plasma in a 1D model), the equations are now solved in 2D including the contribution of both the slow and fast waves, with a low computational cost. This approach is completed either by a full-wave computation of the antenna that takes into account its detailed geometry or by a mode-matching code dedicated to multijunctions modelling, which is convenient in preliminary design phases. Moreover, ALOHA can treat more realistic scrape-off layers in front of the antenna, by using a two-layer electron density profile. The ALOHA code has been compared with experimental results from Tore Supra LH antennas of different geometries, as well as benchmarked against other LH coupling codes, with very good results. Once validated, ALOHA has been used as a support for the design of COMPASS and ITER LH antennas and has shown to be a fast and reliable tool for LH antenna design.},

  Abstract                 = {The propagation of lower hybrid waves in the presence of ponderomotive density fluctuations is considered. The problem is treated in two dimensions and, in order to be able to correctly impose the boundary conditions, the waves are allowed to evolve in time. The fields are described by <i>i</i><i>v</i><sub>&tau;</sub> &minus; &int; <i>v</i><sub>&xi;</sub> <i>d</i>&zeta; + <i>v</i><sub>&zeta;&zeta;</sub> + |<i>v</i>|<sup>2</sup><i>v</i> = 0 where <i>v</i> is proportional to the electric field, &tau; to time, and &zeta; and &xi; measure distances across and along the lower hybrid ray. The behavior of the waves is investigated numerically. If the amplitude of the waves is large enough, the spectrum of the waves broadens and their parallel wavelength becomes shorter. The assumptions made in the formulation preclude the application of these results to the lower hybrid heating experiment on Alcator&ndash;A. Nevertheless, there are indications that the physics embodied in this problem are responsible for some of the results of that experiment.},

  Abstract                 = {A large amplitude wave strongly modulates, due to ponderomotive forces, the plasma density in the low-temperature boundary layer (Morales, 1977; Chan and Chiu, 1979). These density modifications at the plasma edge are important for the lower hybrid waves propagation (Bers 1978), cf. the case studied experimentally in the Alcator Tokamak (Surko et al., 1979). The authors point out that the action of the ponderomotive forces in the boundary layer leads to generation of (at least one) spatial harmonic which propagates to the plasma interior. This effect stems from the z-dependence of nonlinear density modulations, which has not been included in the theoretical papers cited above. As the Landau damping is very sensitive to the value of the z-component of the wave vector, the spatial harmonics can be absorbed much more strongly than the original wave.},

  Abstract                 = {The launching of RF waves from a two- and four-waveguide array is studied. From Brambilla's grill theory, analytic expressions for the reflection coefficients, the power spectrum and the fields in the slab model of a cold inhomogeneous plasma are derived. As a first approximation to the coupling problem, only the fundamental mode in the waveguides is considered, the fast wave in the plasma is neglected and the density profile near the plasma edge is assumed to be linear. It is shown that for a fourwaveguide array with alternate 0, ? phases, optimum coupling is obtained when the inside waveguides carry about four times the power of the outside ones. This reduces and equalizes the waveguide reflection coefficients and avoids excessive shifts of the penetrated power spectrum to low values of the wavenumber parallel to the magnetic field.},

  Abstract                 = {A study of radiofrequency current ramp-up in the PLT tokamak is reported. The plasma current was first raised to 200&ndash;300 kA by the Ohmic heating transformer, and the current in the transformer primary circuit was then held constant to remove the OH drive. After the current fell below 200 kA, up to 300 kW of toroidally-directed RF power at 800 MHz was transmitted into the PLT plasma via a 6-element phased waveguide array. Current ramp-up rates between 0 and 120 kA/s for a 0.35 s time interval ((&frac12;&ndash;1/3) <i>L</i>/<i>R</i> time) where measured at densities between 2 and 4 &times; 10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>&minus;3</sup>. It is estimated that about 20\% of the RF energy introduced into the vacuum vessel was converted into poloidal magnetic field energy, <i>LI</i><sup>2</sup>/2, where <i>L</i> &cong; 3 &mu;H is the total inductance of the plasma current loop. This conversion ratio should depend on a variety of factors, including the percentage of RF power absorbed by resonant electrons and the magnitude of the back current induced by the changing poloidal flux <i>LI</i>. The high ramp-up efficiencies are predicted theoretically in the regime in which the PLT ramp-up experiments operate, i.e., where the phase velocity of the waves is approximately equal in magnitude to the runaway velocity due to the back voltage. Comparison of the raw data with theory suggest that about &frac12; to &frac34; of the incident RF power is absorbed by resonant high-velocity electrons.},

  Abstract                 = {Previously, it has been shown that in a cold, inhomogeneous, magnetized plasma half-space the lower-hybrid resonance is accessible to the transverse-magnetic (TM) plane waves incident on the vacuum-plasma interface at an approximately grazing incidence, provided that at the hybrid layer ? pe /? ce ? 0.4. In this paper, these results are extended to the slow-wave case when n z , the refractive index in the static magnetic field direction, exceeds unity. It is found that the plasma is indeed accessible to the slow waves if Golant's accessibility criterion n z > 1 + (? pe /? ce ) 2 is satisfied. The following recommendations can be made for coupling r.f. energy to the lower-hybrid resonance: (i) if ? pe /? ce ? 0.4, efficient coupling is possible by launching TEM-like waves on the plasma column, (ii) if ? pe /? ce ? 0.4 and if the transverse machine dimensions exceed the r.f. vacuum wavelength, it is possible to couple TM waves using passive slow-wave structures inside the machine walls, (iii) if ? pe /? ce ? 0.4, but for smaller machine dimensions, recourse must be taken to transverse-electric slow-wave coupling with current-carrying coils of appropriate periodicity . If, as was pointed out by Glagolev, propagation from the plasma edge to the hybrid layer is not materially affected by the inclusion of finite-temperature effects, by far the most elegant solution (with potential application to thermonuclear plasmas) for coupling r.f. energy from the second to the twentieth ion-cyclotron harmonic waves is by launching TEM-like waves in the coaxial waveguide formed by the plasma columnand the containing walls.},

  Abstract                 = {Coupling structures for lower hybrid current drive experiments have, until now, been smaller than a free space wavelength and have had a correspondingly broad wavenumber spectrum. The paper reports the results of experiments on the PLT tokamak using a 16-waveguide grill (2.2 wavelengths) which produces a very narrow n ? = k ? c/? spectrum. Experimental results from the 16-waveguide grill are compared with results from three other PLT grills with less sharply defined n 1 spectra. The current drive figure of merit, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/28/2/004/nf_28_2_004inline1.gif] , is approximately 40% higher for the experiments with the 16-waveguide coupler than for previously reported experiments on PLT, in spite of the larger 'spectral gap'. The experimental results are consistent with the first-pass damping of a large fraction of the launched spectrum.},

  Abstract                 = {Launching of the fast wave in the lower hybrid frequency range is described. This wave is excited at the plasma edge by RF electric fields perpendicular to those required for the lower hybrid wave. In high-temperature plasmas, where the lower hybrid wave may not penetrate because of Landau damping or other effects near the edge, the fast wave might provide an alternative for heating and/or current generation in the central portion of the plasma. In addition, for high-density plasmas, this has the advantage that lower frequencies than those required for the lower hybrid excitation can be used. Thus waveguides of convenient dimensions for maximum power transmission and ease of fabrication can be employed. Coupling from a waveguide array into an inhomogeneous plasma is analysed. The model is infinite in y, the direction perpendicular to magnetic field and density gradient. Power reflection in the waveguides is found as a function of array design and density gradient at the edge. This reflection is fairly large (> 20%). Propagation into the plasma is then considered, and the field structure and dispersion of the fast waves are found as functions of the distance of penetration. Unlike the lower hybrid waves, fast waves do not form resonance cones and energy is dispersed over a large volume.},

  Abstract                 = {A 2 MW-2.45 GHz lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) system was designed, fabricated and installed successfully on EAST in 2008 to investigate high performance regimes and achieve a steady-state operation. The system is composed of 20 continuous wave (CW) klystron amplifiers, 4 sets of high voltage power supply, 20 standard rectangle waveguide (American National Standard, WR430) transmission lines with a length of 30 m to 40 m for each, and a multi-junction grill containing 160 active (in groups of 8) and 25 passive sub-waveguides arranged in 5 rows and 4 columns. Fixed phase shifters in sub-waveguides and electronically-controlled digital phase shifters driving each klystron are used to control the radiated power spectrum of the grill. By means of LHCD, a plasma current of 150 kA to 500 kA at a central plasma density of 1 ? 10 13 cm ?3 to 2 ? 10 13 cm ?3 and a toroidal magnetic field of 2.0 T to 2.5 T was achieved. Both a fully non-inductive plasma current of 250 kA lasting up to 23 s and the ramp up were achieved. These results successfully demonstrated the capability of the LHCD system. The system is described in detail and the primary experimental results are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {{RF heating in the vicinity of the lower-hybrid resonance frequency has been shown to be an efficient method to heat plasmas. The best results are obtained when the frequency is a few times (2-4) the maximum lower hybrid frequency. The temperature profile is then peaked in the center while it becomes hollow at lower frequencies. Nonlinear processes are responsible for the heating, probably through parametric decays and nonlinear Landau damping. The extrapolation of this technique to the large Tokamaks which are being built and to the larger ones contemplated as reactors encounters new problems of accessibility which are examined. }},
